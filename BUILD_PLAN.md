All Phase 0 exit criteria met. Foundation ready for Phase 1 implementation.

---

Phase 1 — Tenancy, Auth, Roles, RLS, Audit (Week 1 → Week 2)

Objectives

Establish multi‑tenant model, roles, and row‑level security; immutable audit log; core tables and enums scaffolded.

Key deliverables

Tables: workspaces, user_workspace_roles, shared enums (role, item_type, inv_txn_type, etc.).

RLS default‑deny across all tables + role policies; column‑level cost visibility (hide unit_cost unless allowed).

Audit log with hash chain (prev_hash/curr_hash) and INSERT‑only policy.

Auth bootstrap (Supabase Auth email/password; OAuth later) and invite flows; role assignment UI skeleton.

Implementation details

JWT claims carry workspace_id and roles; helper SQL functions: get_jwt_workspace_id(), has_role().

Views to redact costs for roles (e.g., v_item_lots).

Testing

RLS tests (critical): for every table, positive/negative test matrix per role (pgTAP).

Audit immutability: property test—no UPDATE/DELETE allowed; hash chain continuity.

E2E: invite → accept → role‑aware navigation (Contract Brand viewer sees limited data, no costs). UI role scoping per blueprint.

Exit criteria

Pen test of RLS (internal): cannot read/write across workspaces; costs hidden for Brewer.

Audit entries created for all "posting" RPCs (temp placeholders).

--- EXTRA DETAILED PHASE 6 FOR THOROUGH IMPLEMENTATION ---
Absolutely—here’s a **drop‑in, expanded spec** for your Phase 6 that adds the regulatory context, formulas, schema/RPC/UI detail, and test plan so engineering can implement BROP, Excise, Transfers in bond, and Contract/Alt end‑to‑end on **Next.js + Supabase + Stripe** exactly as your stack intends. It references your technical and UI blueprints and folds in the TTB/CFR guidance noted below. &#x20;

---

## Phase 6 — Compliance engine (expanded): BROP + Excise + Transfers in bond + Contract/Alt

**Window:** Week 7 → Week 9

> **Purpose**
> Produce **Brewer’s Report of Operations (BROP)** (monthly or quarterly), **Excise Tax Return support** (TTB F 5000.24 worksheet & export), and **Transfers in bond** (same or different ownership) with printable documents and immutable period snapshots. Attribute production/removals for **contract brewing & alternating proprietorships**.

---

### 1) Regulatory context we’re encoding (what & when)

* **BROP filing cadence & due date.** Brewer files **monthly** if >\$50k beer tax liability last year or expects >\$50k this year; otherwise **quarterly** is permitted. **Due by the 15th day** after the end of the reporting period. ([Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau][1])
* **Excise Tax Return (TTB F 5000.24).** Tax is paid by **return on F 5000.24**, with return periods **semi‑monthly by default**, or **quarterly** if prior‑year liability ≤\$50k and current‑year expected ≤\$50k, or **annual** if ≤\$1,000 (eligibility rules apply). **Due the 14th day** after the last day of the return period (special September rule exists). ([eCFR][2])
* **Taxable removals.** Net taxable removals for the return = **barrels removed for consumption or sale** **minus** **barrels returned** to the same brewery in the same period. (This is what flows onto F 5000.24 Line 11 for beer.) ([Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau][3])
* **Beer tax rates (domestic).** Reduced rates under CBMA: for a domestic brewer producing ≤2,000,000 bbl/year, **first 60,000 bbl at \$3.50/bbl**, **over 60,000 and up to 6M at \$16/bbl**; above 6M at standard rate. ([Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau][4])
* **Apportionment across commonly owned breweries.** The **60,000 bbl** reduced‑rate pool is **apportionable** across breweries a company owns; keep records of the apportionment and apply it to the **first eligible barrels removed** in the year. ([Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau][5])
* **Transfers in bond.** Allowed **between breweries of same ownership**, and since 2023 also allowed **between breweries not of the same ownership** (without payment of tax) per TTB Procedure 2023‑1. ([Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau][6])
* **In‑bond documentation minimums (invoice).** For each transfer: serially numbered invoice or commercial record marked **“transfer without payment of tax”** including names/addresses of shipper/receiver, date, container counts/sizes and total bbls (and bulk container identity); used to prepare daily records and the BROP for both facilities. ([eCFR][7])
* **Units & rounding.** BROP reported in **barrels (31 gal)**; **round to second decimal place**. ([Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau][1])
* **Retention.** Keep BROP/return copies and supporting records **≥3 years** (TTB may extend by up to 3 more). ([eCFR][8])

> **Implementation note**: These rules are encoded as settings & validations (no UI guesswork). The Compliance Center shows **due‑date banners** for both BROP and Excise periods and enforces **period locks & immutable snapshots** once finalized (below).&#x20;

---

### 2) Data model (additions & enums)

(Extends §2.6 of your schema.)&#x20;

**Tables (confirm/augment):**

* `ttb_periods(id, workspace_id, type enum 'monthly|quarterly', period_start, period_end, status enum 'open|draft|finalized', due_date, filing_frequency_excise enum 'semi_monthly|quarterly|annual', remarks text)`
* `ttb_entries(id, workspace_id, period_id, line_code text, category enum ‘opening|produced|received_in_bond|returned_to_brewery|overage|special_addition|removed_tax_determined|removed_without_tax|consumed_on_premises|destroyed|loss|shortage|closing|total|adjustment_add|adjustment_rem’, quantity_bbl numeric(12,2), source_table text, source_id uuid, owner_entity_id uuid null, notes text)`
* `excise_worksheets(id, workspace_id, period_id, filing_frequency, net_taxable_bbl numeric(12,2), cbma_allocation_used_bbl int, rate_bands jsonb, amount_due_cents bigint, payload jsonb)`
* `compliance_snapshots(id, workspace_id, period_id, pdf_url, csv_url, content_hash, created_at, created_by)` (immutable; RLS denies update/delete).
* `inbond_transfers(id, workspace_id, shipper_entity_id, receiver_entity_id, same_ownership bool, shipped_at, container_type enum 'keg|case|bulk', doc_number text unique, docs_url text, remarks text)`
* `inbond_transfer_lines(id, transfer_id, finished_lot_id uuid null, bulk_reference text null, qty numeric, uom text, barrels numeric(12,2))`
* `ownership_entities(id, workspace_id, name, ttb_permit_number, address_json, controlled_group_key text null)`
* `settings_compliance(id, workspace_id, brop_hard_stop bool, excise_default_frequency enum, cbma_apportionment jsonb, return_serial_prefix text)`

**Indexes:**

* `ttb_entries(period_id, line_code)`; `excise_worksheets(period_id)`; `inbond_transfers(shipped_at)`; `ownership_entities(controlled_group_key)`.

**Enumerations – BROP line codes (normalized for both 5130.9 & 5130.26):**
`OPENING`, `PRODUCED`, `RECEIVED_IN_BOND`, `RETURNED_TAXPAID`, `OVERAGE`, `SPECIAL_ADD_A`, `SPECIAL_ADD_B`, `REMOVED_TAX_DETERMINED`, `REMOVED_NO_TAX` (exports/supplies/research etc. per Subpart L), `CONSUMED_ON_PREMISES` (not tax determined), `DESTROYED_NONTAXPAID`, `LOST`, `SHORTAGE`, `CLOSING`, `TOTAL`, `ADJ_ADD`, `ADJ_REM`.

> We keep **line\_code** decoupled from the printed line numbers to support both forms; the PDF exporter maps our **line\_code** → form rows for the user’s elected form. ([Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau][9])

---

### 3) Mapping layer (how facts become BROP & Excise)

We compute **ttb\_entries** from authoritative facts (inventory ledger + batch/packaging/removal events) through SQL views/materialized views, then persist rows via RPC.

**Canonical joins:**

* **Opening (OPENING):** prior period **CLOSING** (must match; see validation rule below). ([Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau][10])
* **Produced (PRODUCED):** beer produced by fermentation + any water/other liquids added that increase volume (batch complete to brite, etc.). ([Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau][9])
* **Received in bond (RECEIVED\_IN\_BOND):** inbound in‑bond transfers (our inventory transaction `in_bond` as positive to bond location). ([Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau][1])
* **Returned to brewery (RETURNED\_TAXPAID):** previously taxpaid/determined beer returned and added back as **nontaxpaid** beer. ([Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau][1])
* **Overage / Special additions:** physical inventory overage; spare special rows for TTB‑directed entries. ([Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau][9])
* **Removed tax determined (REMOVED\_TAX\_DETERMINED):** removals for consumption/sale (includes taproom when tax‑determined on transfer to tavern). ([Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau][9])
* **Removed without tax (REMOVED\_NO\_TAX):** qualifying Subpart L removals (export, supplies to vessels/aircraft, research/testing, etc.). ([Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau][9])
* **Consumed on premises (CONSUMED\_ON\_PREMISES):** consumed elsewhere on brewery premises **not** tax determined. ([Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau][1])
* **Destroyed nontaxpaid (DESTROYED\_NONTAXPAID).** ([Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau][1])
* **Loss / Shortage (LOST/SHORTAGE):** known losses vs inventory‑revealed shortages (with remarks). ([Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau][1])
* **Closing (CLOSING):** computed from reconciliation (below) and checked against physical inventory. ([Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau][1])
* **Adjustments (ADJ\_ADD/ADJ\_REM):** corrections related to prior adjusted 5000.24 returns (reported outside period totals per instructions). ([Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau][1])

**Excise worksheet (TTB F 5000.24 support):**

* `net_taxable_bbl = sum(REMOVED_TAX_DETERMINED within return period) − sum(Returns_to_same_brewery_within_period)`; we then apply **CBMA rate bands** with **workspace‑configurable apportionment** for controlled groups. ([Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau][3])
* Store the per‑band math in `excise_worksheets.rate_bands` (e.g., `[{band:"first_60k", rate:350, qty_bbl:..., tax_cents:...}, …]`).

> **Note on cadence split**: BROP periods may be monthly/quarterly, while Excise may be semi‑monthly/quarterly/annual. We derive **two calendars** and keep them independent to mirror TTB. ([eCFR][2])

---

### 4) Core formulas & validations

**Reconciliation identity (period):**
`OPENING + PRODUCED + RECEIVED_IN_BOND + RETURNED_TAXPAID + OVERAGE + SPECIAL_ADD_* − REMOVED_TAX_DETERMINED − REMOVED_NO_TAX − CONSUMED_ON_PREMISES − DESTROYED_NONTAXPAID − LOST − SHORTAGE = CLOSING`

* Policy flag **brop\_hard\_stop** controls warning vs exception on imbalance. *(Default warning during pilot; hard‑stop on GA.)*&#x20;

**Cross‑period continuity:**
`this.OPENING == prior.CLOSING` (first period can be 0). ([Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau][10])

**Excise due‑date computation:**

* For return frequency **semi‑monthly/quarterly/annual**, due **EFT + return** by the **14th day after period end** (Saturday/Sunday/holiday rule). Store computed `due_at` and show banner. ([eCFR][2])

**BROP due date:**

* **15th day** after period end; show status chips and past‑due banner. ([Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau][1])

**Units & rounding:**

* All BROP quantities **bbl**, rounded to **two decimals**; exporter converts to form rounding rules. ([Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau][1])

**Record retention (snapshot immutability):**

* Deny UPDATE/DELETE on `compliance_snapshots`; retention reminder set to ≥ **3 years**; allow admin CSV/PDF download anytime. ([eCFR][8])

---

### 5) RPCs & Edge Functions (domain commands)

> All commands execute in a single DB transaction, write **audit logs**, and accept `dry_run`.

* `rpc.generate_ttb_period(period_id uuid, finalize bool default false)`

  1. Materialize mapping views → `ttb_entries`.
  2. Run `rpc.validate_reconciliation(period_id)`; if **hard‑stop** and invalid → raise.
  3. Render **BROP PDF & CSV** (server‑render; store in Storage), write `compliance_snapshots` with **content\_hash**.
  4. If `finalize=true`, set `ttb_periods.status='finalized'` and lock edits.

* `rpc.build_excise(period_id uuid or return_span daterange)`
  Compute `net_taxable_bbl`, apply **CBMA** rate bands using `settings_compliance.cbma_apportionment` (remaining pool for the calendar year), produce JSON/CSV for **Pay.gov** entry and optional **return serial** prefill per TTB tips (serial begins with year; we’ll increment per calendar year in `return_serial_prefix`). ([Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau][11])

* `rpc.create_inbond_transfer(p jsonb)`
  Validates counterpart **ownership entities**, computes barrels, inserts `inventory_transactions(type='in_bond')`, assigns **doc\_number** (per‑workspace sequence), renders a **printable invoice** marked **“transfer without payment of tax”** with all fields required by **27 CFR 25.186**. ([eCFR][7])

* `rpc.validate_reconciliation(period_id uuid)`
  Enforces identity above; emits anomalies list (shortage without remarks, negative stock, closing mismatch).

> **Where this runs**: long‑running PDF/CSV generation happens in **Supabase Edge Functions** with a job queue; UI calls these via **Next.js** actions; snapshots saved to `docs/` bucket.&#x20;

---

### 6) UX: Compliance Center flows

> Screens I1 (BROP), I2 (Excise worksheet), I3 (Transfers) per your blueprint.&#x20;

**I1 — BROP (Reconciliation grid):**

* Header: Period selector (month/quarter), **Due by MMM 15** chip; status: `Open | Draft | Finalized`. ([Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau][1])
* Grid rows = normalized **line codes**; columns show bbl and info icons with **source drill‑down** (modal shows composing transactions).
* **Anomalies rail:** opening/closing mismatch; shortages need remarks; negative lots.
* Actions: **Generate draft** → preview PDF/CSV → **Finalize & snapshot** (locks entries).
* **Access control:** Accounting/Admin full; Contract Brand viewer sees only entries for their `owner_entity_id`, costs hidden.&#x20;

**I2 — Excise worksheet (F 5000.24 support):**

* Header: return frequency selector (**semi‑monthly/quarterly/annual**), **Due by day 14** chip. ([eCFR][2])
* Cards: **Net taxable removals**, **CBMA band usage** (remaining calendar‑year pool), **Estimated tax due**; **Export CSV** for Pay.gov. ([Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau][3])
* **Settings button** (workspace): CBMA **apportionment** table (if controlled group), **return serial** prefix per TTB tips. ([Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau][11])

**I3 — Transfers in bond wizard:**

* Stepper: **Counterpart** (shipper/receiver, same/different ownership), **Containers** (keg/case/bulk with counts & barrel calc), **Review & Print**.
* The generated document is **serially numbered**, marked **“transfer without payment of tax”**, and includes all CFR‑required fields. Link to PDF from transfer detail. ([eCFR][7])
* On **different ownership**, store both breweries’ identity; if receiver is also a BrewCrush workspace, post a mirrored **RECEIVED\_IN\_BOND** suggestion.

**Microcopy examples:**

* Shortage: “Explain cause; unexplained shortages may be taxable.”
* Taproom: “Beer transferred to tavern is **tax determined**; appears in removals.” ([Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau][1])

---

### 7) Contract brewing & Alternating Proprietorships (attribution model)

* Store `owner_entity_id` on **batches** and **finished\_lots**; BROP/Excise attribution flows from ownership at time of production/removal.
* **Alt Prop** guardrails: host vs tenant must each be qualified; records may require variances (e.g., place of maintenance) and must stay available for TTB inspection. ([Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau][12], [eCFR][8])
* **UI:** Contract Brand viewer role sees their periods/snapshots and transfer docs only; no costs.&#x20;

---

### 8) RLS & immutability

* **Default deny** on all compliance tables; period membership via `workspace_id`; column‑level cost redaction already applied elsewhere.&#x20;
* `compliance_snapshots`: **INSERT‑only** policy; **no UPDATE/DELETE**; content hash displayed for audit chain.
* Finalized `ttb_periods` forbid edits to composing transactions; edits require **reopen** admin action with audit trail.

---

### 9) Testing strategy (SQL, integration, E2E)

**Seed scenarios (fixtures):**

* Single brewery quarterly filer; same brewery semimonthly excise.
* Controlled group with **CBMA apportionment** mid‑year reallocation. ([Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau][5])
* Transfers **same ownership** and **different ownership**; taproom removals; exports; returns; losses/shortages with/without remarks.

**SQL / pgTAP (unit):**

* **Mapping tests**: Each input fact (produce, removal, return, in‑bond) lands in the correct **ttb\_entries.line\_code**.
* **Identity property test**: reconciliation holds exactly unless explicit adjustments present.
* **Continuity test**: prior CLOSING == next OPENING. ([Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau][10])
* **Rate band test**: CBMA band consumption and tax arithmetic (edge: pool exhausted mid‑period). ([Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau][4])
* **Cadence test**: Excise frequency due‑dates computed per §25.164(d). ([eCFR][2])

**Edge Functions (Vitest + ephemeral DB):**

* `generate_ttb_period` produces **balanced** entries; PDF/CSV present and hash stored; **re‑runs idempotent**.
* `build_excise` returns correct `net_taxable_bbl` = removals − returns (same period). ([Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau][3])
* `create_inbond_transfer` creates inventory moves and a CFR‑compliant printed invoice including required fields. ([eCFR][7])

**Playwright (E2E):**

* BROP: Create period → see due‑date chip (**15th** rule) → draft → finalize → download snapshot. ([Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau][1])
* Excise: Frequency switch shows correct **14th‑day** due; export CSV; CBMA remaining pool displayed. ([eCFR][2])
* In‑bond: Wizard end‑to‑end → print doc; receiver sees **Received in bond** suggestion.

**Accessibility & offline:**

* Compliance grids meet WCAG 2.1 AA; snapshots downloadable offline (previously cached).&#x20;

---

### 10) Implementation checklists

**Backend (Supabase / SQL):**

* Migrate tables & enums above; enable RLS.
* Views: `v_brop_sources_*` (produced, removals, returns, in\_bond, losses).
* RPCs: `generate_ttb_period`, `validate_reconciliation`, `build_excise`, `create_inbond_transfer`.
* Jobs: nightly **due‑date digest** and **snapshot retention** audit.&#x20;

**Edge Functions:**

* PDF renderer: BROP (monthly/quarterly) and **In‑bond invoice** template with CFR text line “transfer without payment of tax”. ([eCFR][7])
* CSV exporters: BROP detail; Excise worksheet.
* Hashing: `sha256` on JSON payload for snapshot row.

**Frontend (Next.js):**

* **Compliance Center** routes: `/compliance/brop`, `/compliance/excise`, `/compliance/inbond`.
* Components: ReconciliationGrid, AnomaliesPanel, DueDateChip, SnapshotCard, TransferWizard.
* **State**: TanStack Query hooks for period list/detail; react‑hook‑form + Zod for Transfer wizard.

---

### 11) Exit criteria (Phase 6)

* **Pilot datasets** reconcile: BROP **closing = next opening**, Excise **net taxable** matches hand‑calc; **reduced‑rate math** verified with sample controlled‑group apportionment. ([Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau][4])
* **Immutable** snapshots downloadable (PDF+CSV) and blocked from edit by RLS; **transfer invoices** print with all CFR fields. ([eCFR][7])
* **Due‑date banners** show correct dates (BROP **15th**, Excise **14th**) across frequencies. ([Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau][1], [eCFR][2])

---

### 12) Appendix: printable forms & field notes (what we’ll render)

* **BROP (Monthly/Quarterly)**: match TTB row labels; secondary note for **Cereal Beverage** (Part 2) if data present (ABV <0.5%). ([Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau][9])
* **Excise worksheet for Pay.gov**: include **Return Serial** generator (year‑prefixed sequence), payment method note, and **zero‑balance** handling (“Other → none”). ([Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau][11])
* **In‑bond invoice**: title “Transfer Without Payment of Tax”, includes: shipper/receiver names/addresses, shipment date, containers (cases/kegs/bulk) with counts/sizes and **total barrels**, bulk container IDs where applicable; serial number; receiver discrepancy notes block. ([eCFR][7])

> **Compliance disclaimer**: This spec operationalizes federal requirements but is **not legal advice**. Users must confirm state rules and their own eligibility for reduced rates or filing frequencies.

This section slots directly into your **Phase 6** and uses the **Next.js + Supabase** patterns you’ve already standardized—Edge Functions for generation/webhooks, SQL RPCs for domain invariants, and RLS for immutability and role‑aware access—plus the **Compliance Center** UX specified in your UI blueprint.

If you want, I can also produce **DDL & RPC stubs** exactly matching the enums/columns above so your team can paste them into the Supabase migrations and start wiring the UI.

-- END OF PHASE 6 ---

Phase 7 — Sales ingest (CSV/API) → Removals → Keg deposit ledger (Week 9 → Week 10)

Objectives

Ingest POS sales to post removals; minimal keg deposit ledger; error handling with per‑row export.

Key deliverables

Tables: sales_ingest_jobs, sales_ingest_rows, removals, keg_deposit_entries.

Endpoints: /v1/sales-ingest/csv (job + mapping presets) and /v1/sales-ingest/events (idempotent).

UI: Sales ingest wizard with mapping presets (Ekos/Beer30/Ollie/Breww), preview & error CSV; Keg deposit report.

Implementation details

Removals write inventory_transactions (ship/destroy) and flow into Excise taxable removals.

Option to group taproom same‑day removals.

Testing

Integration: ingestion idempotency (doc_ref + sku + date); invalid rows produce error CSV.

E2E: import template → removals posted → Excise totals update.

Reports: keg deposit exports to QBO CSV reflect ledger entries.

Exit criteria

“Brew to BROP & Excise” path complete with removals populated by ingest. Go/no‑go metric is testable.

Phase 8 — Reporting & Dashboards + Recall Drill + PO Aging & Supplier Trend (Week 10 → Week 11)

Objectives

Deliver reports & dashboards per personas; Recall drill; purchasing analytics.

Key deliverables

Reports: Inventory on hand, Batch summary, Production, Packaging output, COGS summary, Recall drill, PO aging, Supplier price trend, Deposit ledger; print/CSV exports.

Dashboards: role‑aware cards (In fermenters, packaged this week, open POs, yeast status, TTB status, COGS/margin).

Implementation details

Materialized views + Realtime counters; saved views (persisted filters).

COGS method badge on cost cards & exports.

Testing

SQL: recall traversal from finished lot to upstream ingredient lots and downstream removals.

Performance: large tables are virtualized; report exports complete < 5s.

a11y: reports printable with proper headings.

Exit criteria

All reports render on seed data; CSV exports validated by Finance.

Phase 9 — PWA/Offline hardening + Outbox UX + Notifications (Week 11)

Objectives

Complete offline envelope for brew/ferm/pack & sales ingest; outbox tray; daily digests & due‑date reminders.

Key deliverables

Service Worker caching shell/assets; IndexedDB outbox with idempotency, retry/backoff, error viewing.

/api/sync → Edge Function pipeline; conflict handling (last‑writer‑wins for simple fields, transactional rejects for domain ops with guided retry UI).

Notifications (digest: low stock, open POs due, tank milestones, BROP/Excise due, transfers pending).

Testing

Playwright offline suite: queue 10+ ferm logs & a packaging post; reconnect; verify 99.5% sync success ≤ 5 min.

Edge Function retry/idempotency tests.

a11y: offline banner & tray are screen‑reader observable.

Exit criteria

Offline success KPI met in staging; telemetry dashboard shows outbox metrics.

Phase 10 — Billing, Plans, Observed Production (OP) suggestions, Dunning (Week 12)

Objectives

Enable paid plans with Stripe; implement Observed Production suggestion banner & schedule‑at‑renewal plan changes; optional setup packages.

Key deliverables

Stripe Products/Prices: Starter / Growth / Pro monthly/annual; one‑time setup packages.

Webhooks → entitlements + AccountBilling updates; Customer Portal.

ObservedProductionSnapshot job (weekly) with OP formula & grace band; suggestion banners & emails; no retro charges; change at renewal by default.

Settings → Billing UI (plan, invoices, OP trend sparkline, change plan).

Implementation details

For MVP, all tiers include same features; entitlements infra exists but gates are open (config flag), matching pricing intent.

Dunning: 3 retries over 14 days; read‑only mode after window.

Testing

Webhook contract tests (signed secret, idempotent).

E2E: trial → checkout → activate → portal plan switch; OP suggestion triggers from seeded packaging data across two months; “Now” vs “At renewal” paths.

Entitlement drift reconciliation nightly.

Exit criteria

Paywall operational; OP suggestions appear correctly; dunning moves workspace to read‑only after failures.

Phase 11 — Observability, SRE, Security & Performance Hardening

Objectives

Hit SLOs; complete runbooks, backups, and basic SOC2‑track posture; load testing; disaster recovery drill.

Key deliverables

Metrics dashboards: API p95/p99, DB timing (pg_stat_statements), queue lag, outbox success, snapshot errors. Alerts on thresholds.

Backups verified (PITR; quarterly restore drill). RPO 15m, RTO 4h.

Load tests for heavy ops (BROP gen, large exports).

Security: dependency scans, secrets rotation doc, RLS policy review & tests.

SRE runbook: incident playbook, on‑call guide, Stripe webhook replay.

Testing

k6/artillery scenarios for packaging runs & compliance generation; ensure heavy ops < 5s.

Fault‑injection: Edge Function failure & retry; storage outage fallback.

Exit criteria

SLOs met in staging under load; restore drill documented; alerts tested.

Phase 12 — Closed Beta (8–12 breweries), UAT & Polishing

Objectives

Validate “brew to BROP & excise” with real users; close gaps; finalize onboarding flows & help content.

Key deliverables

Onboarding wizard (tanks → import items/lots → yeast strains → recipe → schedule → receive PO → package → generate BROP/excise drafts).

Sample data workspace; contextual tooltips; office hours & in‑app chat placeholders.

Beta feedback capture; QA checklists per module executed.

Testing

Acceptance scenarios from PRD §13/§14.13: POs, Yeast, BROP+Excise, Transfers, Sales ingest—witness tests with pilot breweries.

Analytics confirm activation metrics (time to first batch ≤48h; first PO received ≤14 days; first excise worksheet in period).

Exit criteria

Go/no‑go: ≥70% of pilots abandon spreadsheets/legacy, complete BROP and excise worksheet within first period.

Phase 13 — GA readiness: Docs, Pricing page, Support, Legal

Objectives

Public launch assets & guardrails for scale.

Key deliverables

Marketing Pricing page (copy, FAQ, BBL bands, “unlimited users”) & signup flow that matches attestation pattern.

Support runbooks, SLA, status page; refund policy path (PRD §14.8).

QBO/Xero CSV exports clearly documented; one‑way QBO post queued for Post‑GA.

Testing

Content QA; link checks; plan price calculations and annual discount.

Trial→Paid conversion path measured.

Exit criteria

GA checklist green; sales → onboarding handoff smooth.

Post‑GA Roadmap (from your docs; not blocking launch)

QBO one‑way post, Sales Orders, SSO, API keys/webhooks, keg tracking, delivery runs, sensor integrations (later).

How testing is woven through every phase (practical recipes)

The table below is your “how we test” bill of materials; it’s additive—don’t remove earlier tests as you progress.

1) Database & domain

pgTAP suites for: FIFO/COGS math; blend allocations; lot/date code generator; reconciliation identity; yeast generation rules; in‑bond invariants. Trigger these on every migration.

Row‑level security tests: positive/negative per role, including Contract Brand visibility & cost redaction.

2) Edge Functions / RPC

Vitest integration against ephemeral Supabase: idempotency (Idempotency-Key), dry‑run previews, transactional failures (materials shortfall), PDF/CSV generation stubs.

Contract tests for Stripe webhooks & outgoing webhooks (HMAC) with replay.

3) Frontend

Component tests (Vitest+RTL): forms with Zod; list virtualization; lot override COGS delta badge.

Playwright E2E (mobile/tablet/desktop):

Brew Day Mode offline/online; ferm quick log; tank prompts (“Harvest today?”).

Packaging wizard: multi‑batch blend; code collision rejection; label PDF present.

PO create→approve→receive partial; variance banner; price trend visible.

Compliance Center: due‑date banner; anomalies surfaced; BROP → Finalize & snapshot; Excise worksheet export.

Sales ingest: mapping preset, preview, error CSV, removals posted.

Accessibility: axe CI gate on every screen added in UI blueprint, including Outbox tray and wizard flows.

4) Performance & reliability

Synthetic tests for TTI p95 < 2.5s; API p95 < 400ms; heavy ops < 5s.

Offline sync KPI: 99.5% success within 5 minutes of reconnect (CI scenario + staging canary).

Backup/restore drill quarterly; snapshot immutability checks.

5) Analytics & success metrics

Fire UI events you specified (e.g., po_created, pos_ingest_completed, excise_worksheet_generated, inbond_transfer_created), and build dashboards for activation goals (time to first batch ≤48h; first PO/yeast/excise milestones).

Cross‑cutting implementation notes that de‑risk the build

Offline outbox: envelope {id, op_name, payload, idempotency_key, claims_hash}, batched POST to /api/sync → Edge Fn → SQL RPC; guided rebase for rejected domain ops.

Costing: persist method used on packaging_runs and surface with a badge across UI/exports for trust.

Compliance snapshot: store PDF/CSV + hash; RLS denies UPDATE/DELETE; Contract Brand viewer scoped to their owner_entity_id only.

Pricing & OP: identical feature set across tiers at MVP, fair OP suggestion with two‑month confirm and +10% grace; no retro charges; change at next renewal by default (or Accept now).

Security: “default deny” RLS; no service‑role keys in client; secrets in Vault; audit every posting; WCAG 2.1 AA from day one.

Traceability (PRD/UI → This plan)

Must‑haves (Recipes, Batches, Yeast, Inventory, POs, Packaging, BROP, Excise, Transfers, Sales ingest, Dashboards, Roles, Offline Outbox) are implemented across Phases 2–7, matching MVP scope and mobile‑first/offline UX.

Pricing & Billing flows and OP soft‑check are in Phase 10, matching your public tiers & experience.

NFRs (SLOs, availability, backups) & observability addressed in Phase 11.

What “production‑ready” looks like at the end of this plan

A brewer can create a recipe → brew → ferment → package (blends, lot/date codes) with materials checks, accurate COGS, and offline‑safe logs.

Inventory/POs are traceable with supplier price history and variance flags; reports surface on‑hand/value and PO aging.

BROP (monthly/quarterly) and Excise worksheet generate with reconciliation checks and immutable snapshots; in‑bond transfers printable.

Sales ingest posts removals; Excise totals reflect reality; Recall drill works from any finished lot.

Stripe billing turns trials into paid; Observed Production suggests fair plan changes; dunning safely degrades to read‑only.

SLOs met, backups verified, RLS airtight, a11y passes, and telemetry confirms activation KPIs.
