# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository. Always re-read this file after compacting conversation.

## RULES
1. Think Hard.
2. Always seek a maximally thorough understanding first. Take your time.
3. Never use Simplified or Placeholder code.
4. All you generate code, be maximally thorough. Ensuring your solutions are complete, thorough, and proper.
5. We will do many new things, be prepared to think of new novel solutions.
6. Take your time, we are never in a rush. You can spend a many hours on a given task.
7. Remember to update documentation and explain things to me as we work together.
8. When running commands that may hang, use a 30 second timeout.
9. When we come across bugs, don't witch hunt for a solution. Even if you think you've found it, you are likely still lacking useful information. Continue to spend 14 hours digging through the code to build a more thorough and complete understanding.
