## Risk Assessment

### Identified Risks
1. **Offline conflicts** - Mitigated with idempotency keys
2. **Chart performance** - Addressed with data limits
3. **Export compatibility** - Tested with standard formats

### Remaining Considerations
1. Large dataset performance (>1000 readings)
2. Multi-user offline sync conflicts
3. Browser storage limits
