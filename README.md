- **Deploy**: Deploys to Vercel and Supabase on main branch

## Architecture

### Database Schema

- Multi-tenant with Row Level Security (RLS)
- Workspace-based isolation
- Immutable audit logs with hash chain
- Partitioned tables for high-volume data (fermentation readings)

### Offline Support

- Progressive Web App (PWA) with service worker
- IndexedDB for offline queue
- Idempotent sync with conflict resolution
- Visible outbox with retry/backoff

### Security

- Row Level Security (RLS) for all tables
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Audit logging for all mutations
- Encrypted at rest (AES-256)
